                        LebShops was founded in 2020 by a group of ambitious students to help people in Lebanon buy local products easily, providing a convenient and secure way.
                        Customers can shop from hundreds of local products, including from local sellers, and we deliver directly to a location of your choice, free of charge.
                        We handle all delivery fees , so the price you see at checkout is the final price.
                        You can pay securely using cash on delivery option, which provides the best payment option and the most secure way.
                        You can also ask for a full refund if the product does not arrive the way it was described, or if it was a different item than ordered.</p><br>
